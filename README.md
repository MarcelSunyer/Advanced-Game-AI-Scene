# Multi-Agent Simulation with Behavioral AI Techniques

## Description
This repository houses a project dedicated to creating a dynamic and free scene populated with numerous agents, each following specific behavioral constraints. The primary goal is to implement various artificial intelligence techniques, drawing inspiration from the methodologies covered in relevant course exercises.

## Project Highlights
1. **Diverse AI Techniques:** The project incorporates a multitude of AI techniques explored during the course, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

2. **Behavior Bricks Integration:** Significantly, the behavior of two agents within the scene is exclusively modeled using Behavior Bricks, providing a concrete demonstration of this behavioral design framework.

3. **Player Exclusion:** Notably, the absence of a player entity is a deliberate design choice within the project.
